I'm the Lunchbot of the Guild of the Cross. 
Every month, I organize a lunch lottery
where, by participating, you'll win a lunch companion.
After you join the draw, when the draw day comes, 
I'll draw you a pair from other participants, 
and then together you can arrange a time and place for a lunch.
This way, you might get to know another guild member better!
