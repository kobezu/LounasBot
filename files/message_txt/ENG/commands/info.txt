Hello, I'm the Lunchbot of the Guild of Cross. 
Every month, I organize a lunch lottery where, by participating, you'll win a lunch companion!
\n\nYou can participate the draw while the lunch lottery is active - I'll notify you about this via message. 
After you join, when the draw day comes, I'll draw you a pair from other participants, and then together you can arrange a time and place for lunch. 
This way, you might get to know another guild member better!
