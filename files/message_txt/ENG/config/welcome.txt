Hello, I'm the Lunchbot of the Guild of the Cross. 
Every month, I organize a lunch lottery where, by participating, you'll win a lunch companion!
\n\nYou can enter the draw while the lunch lottery is active - I'll notify you about this via message. 
After you join, when the draw day comes, I'll draw you a pair from other participants, and then together you can arrange a time and place for a lunch. 
This way, you might get to know another guild member better!
\n\nNow, tell me what language you want to use at lunch, and then you'll be ready to join the next lunch lottery.
