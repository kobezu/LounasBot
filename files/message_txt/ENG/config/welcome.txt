Hello, I'm the Lunchbot of the Guild of the Cross! 
Every month, I organize a lunch lottery - I'll notify you of this via message - 
where, by participating, you'll win a lunch companion!
\n\nAfter you join, when the draw day comes, 
I'll draw you a pair from other participants, 
and then together you can arrange a time and place for a lunch.
This way, you might get to know another guild member better!
\n\nNow, tell me what language you want to use at lunch, 
and then you'll be ready to join the next lunch lottery.
